The way I thought to fix this issue with balls 57-75 being skewed is by normalizing
each number's probability. We can do this by looping through each number 1-75,
subtracting the lowest number probability by the probability we are normalizing, 
and then dividing that by the highest number probability by the lowest number 
probability. Then we simply set our old probability of the number we are looping 
through to the new normalized probability.
